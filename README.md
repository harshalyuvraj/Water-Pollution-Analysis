1. Objectives

To design and implement a full-stack web application for analyzing and storing water pollution data.

To provide category-wise analysis of pollution (Physical, Chemical, Biological, Air Quality, Environmental).

To enable real-time data storage, retrieval, and visualization using MongoDB as backend.

To assist in decision-making for water quality assessment and treatment planning.

2. Process

a) Project Architecture & Tools

Frontend: EJS templates, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB (collections for physical, chemical, biological, air, environmental, and information data)

Middleware: Authentication & authorization using JWT

Deployment: Local + cloud hosting (if deployed)

b) Implementation Steps

Database Modeling â€“ Designed schemas for PhysicalData, ChemicalData, BiologicalData, AirQualityData, EnvironmentalData, and User Authentication.

Backend Development â€“ Implemented RESTful APIs for data input, storage, and retrieval.

Frontend Development â€“ Created dynamic forms for category-wise data entry and visualization.

Search Feature â€“ Integrated a unique sample ID-based search system to fetch all category-wise results on the main page.

Authentication System â€“ Built sign-in/sign-up pages with password hashing using bcrypt.

Error Handling & Debugging â€“ Fixed form validation, route connectivity, and data consistency issues.

Expansion â€“ Added AQI calculator page, structured result containers, and redirection after login.

3. Outcomes

Developed a working full-stack system for data-driven water quality analysis.

Successfully stored and retrieved multi-category pollution datasets with unique IDs.

Implemented real-time search & retrieval, improving accessibility for researchers & students.

Created scalable backend structure, extendable to decision support systems.

Enhanced UI/UX with formal login/signup and interactive result display.

Prepared a technical report (~60 pages) detailing methodology, case studies, and analysis.
